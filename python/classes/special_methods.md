__len__ returns the length of the object or collection.

__contains__ tests whether the object contains an item.

__eq__ tests whether two objects are equal.
__add__ is a special "dunder" (double underscore) method used for operator overloading of the addition operator (+). It defines the behavior when you add two objects of a custom class. 

The methods __str__ and __repr__ allow you to define human-readable and unambiguous string representations of your objects, respectively.

By defining methods like __eq__, __ne__, __lt__, __gt__, __le__, and __ge__, you can control how objects of your class are compared.
